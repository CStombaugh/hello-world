I'm a husband and father of two boys. I love running and staying active in general, as well as reading, TV, and movies. I'm currently on active duty in the USCG and working on my coding skills as a means to transfer to the CG Reserves and get a job as a civilian doing what I have really come to enjoy, coding.

I've started learning the basics, HTML, CSS, some JavaScript, along with jQuery and Node.js. Looking forward to digging in deeper. This is my first attempt at learning GitHub and how it works, and I have to say it is pretty exciting.

So let me get started.
